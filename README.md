# AKTVE API Server
This is the RESTful API server for the AKTVE system, as developed by
[Team AKTVE](https://aktve-app.com/). It provides access to the entire AKTVE
system backend, which the AKTVE App uses to provide matching and communication
features to its users.

For the reference for the API that this server provides, take a look at this
repository's Wiki on Github.

## Credits & References
This server's initial conception is heavily based on [version 9 of Cory Lanou's RESTful JSON API example](https://github.com/corylanou/tns-restful-json-api/tree/master/v9), though it has been heavily modified and added on to.
